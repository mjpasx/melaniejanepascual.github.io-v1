<p>I’m so sorry that I haven’t been on for so long! I’ve been extremely busy the past couple of weeks. So let’s see what I’ve done…</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ve met up with a Square worker for breakfast, Vanessa, who is super nice! She had us “run” into Jack Dorsey and she told me about a great AP computer science program for the upcoming year</li>
  <li>We pitched a product to Sheryl Sandberg, who is an amazing woman! I’ll be making another post about our product, the Facebook education network</li>

  <li>I’ve emailed and updated 2 of my teachers, who I’m really excited to see again next week!</li>
  <li>My APWH/APUSH asked me to help him next year to make the school website! I really want to help, but I don’t know if I have a free period :(</li>
  <li>I’m working on my final project, my animal matchmaker website/mobile app (it’s debatable) I decided to work alone and I promise I’ll make another post about it when it’s completed after graduation!</li>
  <li>For graduation, I offered to make a slideshow full of pictures, which I am really excited for! It’s asked to be done by Monday, so this is going to be a busy weekend!</li>
  <li>Last friday, we took a field trip to Google HQ by Palo Alto and got to meet Megan Smith and Steve Lee! Two very influential people, where Steve Lee made Google Glass and Megan Smith well… just google her ;)</li>

  <li>Hmm… oh! I’ve begun expanding my @avoiceforanimals instagram account to other social media! I’ll make a post all about that! :D
Mentorship monday! I love this aspect, my mentor Kelly, loves my ideas and love for animals and she has been hooking me up with so much people and supports me so much. I look forward to that 30 minute talk every monday. She brought me to the twisitor house too! It’s so cool</li>
