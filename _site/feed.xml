        <title>Starting in the Tech World: Freshmen &amp; Sophomores</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Whenever I hear a friend tell me that they are interested in computer science, I immediately get excited and start listing different opportunities until I realize they are looking at me like I’m crazy. 
As the summer comes to a close, people have asked me for opportunities - I realized my notebook had different opportunities and resources that I have collected over time and I want to share it. This post is meant for students who hold an interest in technology/engineering and may want to initiate their career in it. 
(Note: Many of things are links to other articles and resources written by awesome people, I just wanted to put it all in one spot instead of sending people hundreds of links :D )
Things that have an asterisk are things I participated/will participate in, so I’m more than happy to help or talk about the experience.
Also, did I mention that almost all of the things listed are free? 
To start off…
it’s important to have a resume! A resume should include things such as side projects, experiences, education, etc. The best guide for getting a tech internship is Getting a Gig, by Cassidy Williams. 
It would also be helpful to know what recruiters look for, specifically for freshmen and sophomores in college. Calla Jun wrote A Freshman’s Guide to Tech Internships to provide insight on what interviewers look for in students that just started college. 
Now, you have an improved resume and understanding of what companies look for!
Building your brand = doing a bunch of fun things with tech
Hackathons:
A hackathon is an event where you and your team build something (software/hardware) within a time limit. Feel free to look at Caeley’s Guide to the Hacker Universe as she describes her experience applying and participating in a bunch of hackathons. 
Here are some popular hackathons that provide travel reimbursement because everything is better when it’s free:
HackMIT*
PennApps
Hack the North
Tree Hacks
HackGT*
YHack
/hack*
HackAList is an open source website of hackathons around the world and you can change the list to hackathons that provide travel reimbursement. Additionally, Major League Hacking is the student hacking league with a bigger list of hackathons in North America and Europe.
One-time programs:
(Another note: a handful of them are geared towards women)
Qualcomm Women Collegiate Conference*
Target Women in Tech Symposium
D.E. Shaw Discovery Fellowship
Square Code Camp
Twitter Early Bird Camp
Qualcomm DECA
Conferences:
(that offer travel/registration scholarships)
PyCon*
Docker Conference
Tapia Conference
Start @ Startup
Grace Hopper Celebration (Freia updates a List of GHC Scholarships)*
Lesbians Who Tech*
WWDC by Apple
NSF Cybersecurity Summit
WeCode by Harvard
Out For Undergrad
General Opportunities:
She++ Ambassador Program
Clarifai Champions
Virtual Student Foreign Service eInternship*
MIT Digital Currencies Initiative: Intro to Cryptocurrencies Bootcamp
Women Techmakers*
Now that you exposed yourself to the tech world and built some cool things, it’s time to apply to internships!!
Work in Tech: 
Here are a list of internships targetted to underclassmen.
Google Engineering Practicum (freshmen/sophomores)
Microsoft Explore Program (freshmen/sophomores)
Facebook University (freshmen)
Pinterest Engage (freshmen)
#TwitterAcademy (freshmen)
Bank of America Freshman Aspire Program (freshmen)*
Bank of America Summer Analysts (sophomores)
Code2040 Fellowship
JP Morgan Summer Undergraduate (freshmen/sophomores)
Goldman Sachs (Sophmores)
General Electric 
Be a teacher assistant for Girls Who Code/Flatiron School!* 
These are big companies - smaller companies/startups hire interns too. If you see a startup you like, email the people expressing your interest in their mission and product, then explain how you’d like to be a part of the team. I’ve done it as a high schooler, it could work for you too. 
Interview Tips:
Behavioral
Here are a couple of popular behavioral questions:
Explain your role in a side project
Describe a challenge you experience when you worked on a team and how you overcame it
Why are you interested in (insert companies name here)
What are you looking for in the internship
Explain a time you held a leadership role
Technical:
Participate in the 30 Days of Code to improve your skills
Cracking the Code Interview is a popular book that people use to practice interview questions (freshmen/sophomores applicants probably won’t be asked as advanced questions as the ones in the book)
LeetCode is an online platform with a bunch of tech questions
Study general data structures! You’ve probably taken only a couple of computer science courses, which recruiters know
It’s okay to say that you don’t know a concept during the technical interview. I literally had one interview where the engineer taught me what a while do statement was (and still got a positive result!)
That’s it - hopefully this helps somebody out there and that you do something cool with code!!
Feel free to message or email me (melaniejane.pascual@gmail.com) with questions/comments/recommendations or just say hi :)&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Independence: my blessing and my curse</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since I started high school, I longed to be independent. I wanted to be able to make my own decisions and refused to need anybody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My aunts, who grew up in a traditional Filipino house, would say how they’re proud of me for being tough and independent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I should’ve been happy because I’m at that point in my life where I travel for work and for school, I have my own income by working and my school is taken cared of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to find the right independence, not one where we’re completely separate, but not where I need somebody completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-made mistakes like traveling to another country
-figuring things out on my own&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>19 years later, I've stopped procrastinating (Oh and I finished my first year at college!)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughout high school, I was one of those people that claimed they would not procrastinate on the next assignment, but still continued to do so. This continued into college - until it didn’t work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always had trouble with time management, but it wasn’t the only thing I struggled with in college. I never expected myself to get homesick because I was someone excited for the next chapter of my life. I couldn’t wait to live in a dorm and explore the east coast. In college, I definitely could not get away with procrastination, though I thought I could. I still remember failing one midterm with a 40% and got a 60% on another assessment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had to cope with the significant difference between Middlebury and my high school. I went from a place where the only white people were our teachers that occasionally acted like a white savior to a place where more than 75% of the student body was white. It didn’t help during orientation when others spoke about their many travels for vacation or their favorite moment in their private boarding school. It was clear that I was the minority, but I never knew how to confront it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With grades, I was finally on the other side. I was the person getting angry that another student is complaining about their 89% on an exam. I began to get myself together when one of my professors sat down with me to discuss my exam - what I didn’t understand and what I can further improve on. It was that moment that I’m glad I chose to attend a small college of 2,500, I received the attention that I needed in order to improve my grades. The professor, who also happened to be an educational psychologist, matched me with two juniors that I could study with and gave me advice on taking tests effectively. My writing seminar professor assisted me in signing up for the learning center to look over both my drafts and my finals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some time management tips:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) Plan ahead - this can save money as well. College courses provide a syllabus that highlight a schedule for the entire semester. Like many freshman, I bought all the books despite barely using it or the library having it. This goes for big assignments as well. The amount of assignments you have depends on many facots, but put them on a calendar and put personal deadlines before it. Examples are having a draft done the week before or doing half a coding assignment by a certain time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Put it somewhere. Your entire schedule - activities, lunches, extracurriculars - should be together somewhere. Many students prefer Google Calendar or Trello, but I prefer writing it down. I print out weekly planners so that I can see clearly which specific blocks of time I’m free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) You can get sleep. For some reason, I had this mindset that describe&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Don't Call My Hard Work Luck</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Don’t call my hard work “luck”
“I’m a great believer in luck and I find that the harder I work, the luckier I am”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was a quote my AP World History teacher often said to use during the course. I love luck myself; whether I win a class raffle or I get two sodas from a vending machine after only paying for one. Though, I never really thought that the concept of luck an ever be a bad thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was last November, when I got invited to attend the Made with Code celebration in Washington DC. When I announced the (amazing) news, a lot of people congratulated me by telling me I’m lucky, while only two people told me that it was something I earned. This “You’re so lucky” comment came from family, close friends, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought to myself, was this luck? I felt as though it was something I earned because I worked extremely hard to host the Made with Code event and my hard work paid off when 70 (50 girls) of the 500 students attended my event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this, people said I was lucky as if Google randomly chose my name from a hat. When, in reality, I was one of nine students nationwide invited by Google to attend an all paid trip to Washington DC and selected to speak about my story with code at the Women in High Tech Coalition in the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I thought this would stop after I attended the DC trip was over, but I see it continuing to happen with college acceptances/rejections as well. People try to use affirmative action and luck as an excuse for someone getting accepted into college, as if their hard work over four years wasn’t the actual reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even something as simple as a class activity, where I, a non-native Spanish speaker, got a higher score than a majority of students, who are native Spanish speakers. After the teacher congratulated me, a classmate claimed it was because I was lucky and just happened to study the terms on the quiz, when I studied everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This frustrates me because in these specific situations, it seems as though my success was due to me having “luck” rather than to my hard work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, unless the situation was a random sweepstakes, where everyone had an equal chance, I say that everyone’s prizes, acceptances, or successes are earned because of their hard work, not because of luck.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Made With Code Celebration at Washington DC</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Google invited me to the Made With Code Celebration in Washington DC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 21, I received AMAZING news from Google that they were inviting me for an all expense paid trip to Washington DC for the National Tree Lighting Ceremony and Made with Code celebration. I was in Washington DC from December 3-5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 3:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent the majority of the day traveling and I arrived at Washington DC around 3 pm. I remember getting excited to buy a Dunkin’ Donut because I haven’t had one for over 9 years. My hotel was in Downtown Washington DC, so the White House was literally 3 blocks away. After I finished packing, I went around to stores and bought some food for myself! My tickets, itinerary, and debit card were given to me at the hotel. I attended the welcome dinner and met other Googlers and girls apart of other companies at a restaurant called Cosi. After, Natalie arrived from her flight and we ate at The Hamilton restaurant! Then, we went to the White House at 11pm. It was funny because we thought the treasury department was the white house until we saw all of the security as we went in. We also saw the Washington Monument! The buildings were so nice and then we went back to the hotel room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 4:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7:35, we were in the bus on our way to the Women in High Tech Coalition Breakfast with Representative Brooks and Representative Delbene. I met Maddy and Danielle, some of the makers of Made With Code. At the breakfast, one of the Googlers asked me to speak at the podium!! It was crazy because I was able to do it without any note cards and I spoke about how I brought computer science into my community. After the breakfast, people came up to me (a person who worked for Technovation, a legislative assistant, member of Girls Inc, and Senator Delbene herself!). Afterwords, we went to the Capitol: took a tour AND got to see a vote on whether Obama should be able to make some decision (I forgot). For lunch, we visited Google Headquarters in Washington DC and I was interviewed for some Made With Code video. It was really different when there were three cameras pointing at you and there were 10 people behind those cameras!! Then, we got to take a tour of the First Ladys Office/ East Wing of the White House! It was so beautiful because the White House was decorated for Christmas and I met many other people like the Executive Officer of the First Lady! We checked in for the National Tree Lighting Ceremony around 4 and saw so many performers like Ne-yo, Patti Labelle, Fifth Harmony and more! It was inspiring to see trees coded by so many people come to live next to the Christmas tree. Our seats were really close to the front as well and I got to see Obama. Made with Code also hosted a VIP reception and I met Fifth Harmony and Neyo! (fangirled inside of course). Then, Natalie and I wanted to make the most of our trip so we went to the Lincoln Memorial and it was so beautiful. We went to the war memorial as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;December 5:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had 3 hours of sleep, so I had to wake up at 4:30 for my flight. At the airport, I decided to get my family food as souvenirs because it’s something they can actually use and like, I brought home a ton of donuts and east coast sandwiches! The flight I had was for Virgin America First Class (it was amazing of course). There were only 10 people in my flight too! So it was really spacious, but I fell asleep for most of the flight and then I was back home in California. The entire trip was amazing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interviewing for the Made with Code behind the scene video.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Women in High Tech Coalition breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Danielle, a Made With Code maker, at the White House!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;image&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Natalie in front of the beautiful capitol building&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>August 8, 2013 life update</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;august-8-2013-life-update&quot;&gt;August 8, 2013 Life Update&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m so sorry that I haven’t been on for so long! I’ve been extremely busy the past couple of weeks. So let’s see what I’ve done…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve met up with a Square worker for breakfast, Vanessa, who is super nice! She had us “run” into Jack Dorsey and she told me about a great AP computer science program for the upcoming year&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We pitched a product to Sheryl Sandberg, who is an amazing woman! I’ll be making another post about our product, the Facebook education network&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sheryl sandberg photo&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’ve emailed and updated 2 of my teachers, who I’m really excited to see again next week!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;My APWH/APUSH asked me to help him next year to make the school website! I really want to help, but I don’t know if I have a free period :(&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m working on my final project, my animal matchmaker website/mobile app (it’s debatable) I decided to work alone and I promise I’ll make another post about it when it’s completed after graduation!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;For graduation, I offered to make a slideshow full of pictures, which I am really excited for! It’s asked to be done by Monday, so this is going to be a busy weekend!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Last friday, we took a field trip to Google HQ by Palo Alto and got to meet Megan Smith and Steve Lee! Two very influential people, where Steve Lee made Google Glass and Megan Smith well… just google her ;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;google image&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hmm… oh! I’ve begun expanding my @avoiceforanimals instagram account to other social media! I’ll make a post all about that! :D
Mentorship monday! I love this aspect, my mentor Kelly, loves my ideas and love for animals and she has been hooking me up with so much people and supports me so much. I look forward to that 30 minute talk every monday. She brought me to the twisitor house too! It’s so cool&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;twisitor image&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Girls Who Code Diaries</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;July 5, 2013&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 24th, I started my Girls Who Code computer science program. I expected to be working on computers and “coding” (I didn’t know what it was). I wasn’t expecting much, but it was the complete opposite of my boring idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These past two weeks, I’ve met inspirational people and want us to succeed as girls in computer science. I never thought I would be doing computer science and this program completely changed my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve met so many awesome and inspirational people such as Eric Schiede, CTO of craigslist, Debbie Sterling, CEO of Goldieblox, Dick Costolo, CEO of Twitter, and Vivienne Ming, CEO of socos and Chief Scientist of Gild.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I’ve learned the language of Scratch and Python, next week I’m learning Javascript. It’s like learning a new language and makes me feel so much smarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our program is sponsored by Twitter, so I’ve learned to take Bart and walk one block to Twitter Headquarters in San Francisco. I feel like I understand the streets of the amazing city more and I feel like an adult, working from 9-5 every morning and waking up at 7. Ever since the Bart strike, I’ve had to wake up at 6:30, It’s only $2.10 to get there and the seats are pretty comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait until we meet the creator of Google Glass and actually try it out. I’ve been emailing a majority of the speakers and I can’t wait until we meet more people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ll encourage people from my school to sign up next year, I can’t wait!&lt;/p&gt;
