			<h2>About</h2>
   
    <p>Hi! My name is Melanie Janeand I’m a rising sophomore at Middlebury College studying computer science &amp; psychology. Last school year, I ran MIDDSTEAM, a STEM+Arts initiative for middle school girls, went to Puerto Rico for a permaculture trip, and played rugby. This summer I interned on the user experience and user interface team at Bank of America in New York and worked on a raspberry pi project.</p>

<p>In the past, I’ve done computer science outreach with organizations such as Made With Code, She++, #ILookLikeAnEngineer, Girls Who Code, and more. I’ve also worked at smaller companies like Flatiron School, GoEnnounce, and KIPP Bay Area Schools.</p>

<p>This upcoming school year, I’ll be working with the Office of Veteran Affairs on their mobile apps team to work on mobile apps with veterans and participating in Kaspersky Academy’s Talent Lab. Additionally, I plan to blog and participate in different hackathons and technology conferences over the school year.</p>
