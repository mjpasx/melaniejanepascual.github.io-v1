Since I started high school, I longed to be independent. I wanted to be able to make my own decisions and refused to need anybody.

My aunts, who grew up in a traditional Filipino house, would say how they're proud of me for being tough and independent. 

I should've been happy because I'm at that point in my life where I travel for work and for school, I have my own income by working and my school is taken cared of. 

I'm trying to find the right independence, not one where we're completely separate, but not where I need somebody completely.
