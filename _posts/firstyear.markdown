Throughout high school, I was one of those people that claimed they would not procrastinate on the next assignment, but still continued to do so. This continued into college - until it didn't work.

In my first semester, I took classes that were completely unrelated to technology because I didn't know whether or not I actually liked technology or that I felt obligated to stydy it since not many did.
My courses for the first semester consisted of International Politics, Adolescent Psychology, and a Ghandi: Myth or Reality seminar.
I originally was in Cell Biology & Genetics, but lacked interest and ended up dropping the course.
My commitments consisted of the following:
* Rugby
* MIDDSTEAM
* HackGT (September)
* Grace Hopper Celebration (October)
* Middlebury Alternative Break Trip: Permaculture in Puerto Rico

As an eager freshman, I wanted to try everything and meet as many people as possible. I loved the extracurriculars I was a part of, but 
it all began to take over my life. As someone who used to procrastinate, I thought my skim over a study guide an hour before a test was good enough. 
It wasn't and I ended up failing my midterms for 2 of my 3 classes, because my exam didn't actually have an exam. 

More obstacles like homesickness and a mix of different injuries from rugby, I felt myself slowly fall apart as the semester went on.
Right when I began to get my academic life together, I received a concussion and my emotional health began to suffer. I was on the other 
side where I despised people who complained about a passing grade that wasn't an A. I spent 2 weeks in my room, angry from headaches and dizziness.

How did I survive?

One of the biggest reasons I chose Middlebury was because of it's small community and that's what helped me get out of this. My professors understood
that my health was more important and when I did come back to school, I was paired with different people by my professors who
were more than happy to help me.
