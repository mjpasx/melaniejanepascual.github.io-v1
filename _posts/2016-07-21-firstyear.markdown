Throughout high school, I was one of those people that claimed they would not procrastinate on the next assignment, but still continued to do so. This continued into college - until it didn't work.

I always had trouble with time management, but it wasn't the only thing I struggled with in college. I never expected myself to get homesick because I was someone excited for the next chapter of my life. I couldn't wait to live in a dorm and explore the east coast. In college, I definitely could not get away with procrastination, though I thought I could. I still remember failing one midterm with a 40% and got a 60% on another assessment. 

I also had to cope with the significant difference between Middlebury and my high school. I went from a place where the only white people were our teachers that occasionally acted like a white savior to a place where more than 75% of the student body was white. It didn't help during orientation when others spoke about their many travels for vacation or their favorite moment in their private boarding school. It was clear that I was the minority, but I never knew how to confront it. 

With grades, I was finally on the other side. I was the person getting angry that another student is complaining about their 89% on an exam. I began to get myself together when one of my professors sat down with me to discuss my exam - what I didn't understand and what I can further improve on. It was that moment that I'm glad I chose to attend a small college of 2,500, I received the attention that I needed in order to improve my grades. The professor, who also happened to be an educational psychologist, matched me with two juniors that I could study with and gave me advice on taking tests effectively. My writing seminar professor assisted me in signing up for the learning center to look over both my drafts and my finals.

Here are some time management tips:

1) Plan ahead - this can save money as well. College courses provide a syllabus that highlight a schedule for the entire semester. Like many freshman, I bought all the books despite barely using it or the library having it. This goes for big assignments as well. The amount of assignments you have depends on many facots, but put them on a calendar and put personal deadlines before it. Examples are having a draft done the week before or doing half a coding assignment by a certain time. 

2) Put it somewhere. Your entire schedule - activities, lunches, extracurriculars - should be together somewhere. Many students prefer Google Calendar or Trello, but I prefer writing it down. I print out weekly planners so that I can see clearly which specific blocks of time I'm free.

3) You can get sleep. For some reason, I had this mindset that describe
