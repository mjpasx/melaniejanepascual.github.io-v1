			During the course of my internship, I incorporated technology programs into school curriculums, attended ed tech conferences, created self service tools to give teachers rapid access to vital information about digital content. At Google’s request, I led a “top secret” project that will culminate in hosting a Made with Code social event at KIPP King. I coded, validated, and archived every single digital content purchases made by our region and planned Innovation Scavenger Hunt for new teacher orientation. I learned a lot more about the work that the regional support office does for the KIPP schools and the significant impact they have.
